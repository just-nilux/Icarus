- This stores the allocated percentage of capital for each strategy in config file.
- It is generated by the resource_allocator.
- It is removed from the DB by the strategy_manager as it consumes the object.
- If there is already an object in DB during the creation of a new object, older ones get deleted

TODO: If allocated amount is less than MIN_NOTIONAL dont create NTO and log warning
