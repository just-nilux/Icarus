NOTE: Currently I imagine it to be so, but there are some problems:
    Suppose we found the pairs that has high volatility and there are some strategies that benefits
    from that. 
    - How market scanner will know which strategy operates better in that conditions?

    An alternative is to provide some kind of analysis dict but reverse:
    "range": ["BTCUSDT"],
    "trending": ["XRPUSDT", "DOGEUSDT"],
    but in this case:
    - How each stratgy or strategy_manager know about the nature and the purpose
    of the strategies which is an abstract consept?
