# Why the market regimes matter?
"Knowing how to trade in different Market Regimes is just as important, if not more so, than what to trade."
# What are the market regimes?
* **Defined Regimes:** Human-defined regimes that is meaningful for humans. There are various subjective definitions to classify market regimes but the ideas they represent are similar and can be reduced to following regime types:
    * UpTrend
    * DownTrend
    * Ranging
    * DropDown(?)
    * JumpUp(?)
* **Undefined Regimes:** ML defined "patterns". That may or may not be meaningful for humans.

# What are the methods to detect market regimes?
* Object detection approach (Supervised learning and drawing rectangles)
* Combination of conventionla tech indicators
    * SQN and ATR
    * Aroon
* Some sort of clustering

# What kind of statistics can be created out of the detected market regimes?
## Primary Statistics:
* Start/End date of regimes
## Secondary Statistics:
* Occurence rate of market regimes
* Dependency relationships and correlations  between Market regimes
* Charachteristics of market states like the volume, length, profitability of each instance

# What kind of usecases may benefit from the market regime statistics?
* Prediction of next market state
* Prediction of the current market regime end time and price ranges.
# Can the market regimes overlap?
