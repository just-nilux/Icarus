# Purpose
Support resistance zones are quite useful to make prediction about the possible price levels that will support or resist. Breakout of these level make indicate an end of a market regime and a start of a new one. 
When placing limit or oco orders, the support-resistance zones may indicate the target price levels. This reseach only focuses on the straight horizontal sr zones not the ones with a slope or curve.
